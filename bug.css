The following CSS code causes an unexpected layout issue in some browsers:

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
div > p {
  width: 50%;
}
```

This code intends to distribute two paragraphs evenly across a flex container, but some browsers may not render this correctly if the total width of the paragraphs exceeds the available space.
